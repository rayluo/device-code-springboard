  Quoted from https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-device-flow-15#section-5.4

  "it is particularly important to confirm that the
  device is in the user's possession, as the user no longer has to type
  the code manually.  One possibility is to display the code during the
  authorization flow and asking the user to verify that the same code
  is being displayed on the device they are setting up."
